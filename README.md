# WavePortal

SOLIDITY / WEB3 - 

This repository will be used to host a *twitter-like* portal created on top of the **Ethereum blockchain**. Users will be able to leave a message in the site and those messages will be persisted to the Blockchain

Also, everytime a user leaves a message, there is a small chance of winning some ETH

- The Smart Contract will be deployed to the **Rinkeby Testnet Network** so there is no real $ involved yet ðŸ˜‰
